    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll consider a version of the transportation problem where we seek to match a continuous distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with a discrete distribution. This problem is called a *semi-discrete transportation* problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, we will introduce this problem not as a matching problem, but as a demand problem. We'll model the demand for facilities (such as schools, stores) in the physical space. The same approach applies to the demand for products (e.g. cars) in the characteristics space, see e.g. Lancaster (1966), Feenstra and Levinsohn (1995), and Berry and Pakes (2007).\n",

The `pysdot` library by Hugo Leclerc and Quentin Mérigot is still at an early stage of development, but is quite promising and easy to `pip install`, so we will adopt it for this course. "
